abstract: "Since the resources of Community Question Answering are abundant and information sharing becomes universal, it will be increasingly difficult to find factual information for questioners in massive messages. SemEval 2019 task 8 is focusing on these issues. We participate in the task and use Generative Pre-trained Transformer (OpenAI GPT) as our system. Our innovations are data extension, feature extraction, and input transformation. For contextual knowledge enhancement, we extend the training set of subtask A, use several features to improve the results of our system and adapt the input formats to be more suitable for this task. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches, which achieves 81.95% of subtask A and 61.08% of subtask B in accuracy on the SemEval 2019 task 8."
