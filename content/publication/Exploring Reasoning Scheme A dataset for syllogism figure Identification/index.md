abstract: "Argument mining aims at extracting structured arguments from texts, in which field argument scheme and its structure are both studied. Syllogism is a traditional argument scheme and its figure is a classical logical property. Existing research has not yet investigated on the syllogism figure, here we bridge this gap by presenting a study on automatic identification of syllogism figure. We propose a novel dataset of 8.6k syllogisms with labeled figure, and carry out the identification task using both supervised and weakly-supervised approaches. Experimental results show both approaches are sufficient."
